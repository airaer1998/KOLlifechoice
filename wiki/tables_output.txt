LXXI, no. 1 (January 18, 2024), pp.&nbsp;6, 8, 10. "There is an anti-modern impulse to Musk, a craving for lordship that can't be entirely satisfied within the confines of a capitalist economy. A king doesn't have advertisers or shareholders or customers, and Musk, if he continues on his current trajectory, may very well be abandoned by all three. [[Aristotle]] says a good ending should be surprising but inevitable. It's possible to imagine multiple finales for Musk that meet these criteria, but the story always begins the same way. Once upon a time in [[Pretoria]], there was a boy who wanted to be a man." (p.&nbsp;10.)
